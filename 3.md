The Discord server is the communication hub for Wings of Fire: The New World. It's just as important as the Minecraft server itself. Both need to be in good condition, upkeep, and activity for the server to be enjoyable. Admins have full administrative permissions on the Discord server. Much of the content in this section is also included in mod training, so this may look familiar. However, there are some admin-specific permissions and processes which you should know.

## Bots

{% include split.html contentleft="

Not unlike the plugins from Section 2, we use a variety of bots to add features and functionality to the Discord server. Each one will be individually addressed, but not all functions and features will be detailed. Generally, we should try to keep the number of bots to a minimum, but if you or another player has a great idea for a bot, ask the rest of the team!

The whitelist functionality is built to handle whitelisting players completely automatically. There are a few things you should know about how exactly it works and what takes place when a player is whitelisted.

When a user on Discord sends a username in the whitelist channel, Dreamvisitor will first check if the username is legal. Minecraft usernames are alphanumeric (including underscores). If the message is not alphanumeric, Dreamvisitor will take no action. This also occurs if the provided username is not able to be found by the Mojang API.

If the username is valid, Dreamvisitor will first fetch the UUID of the username and add it to `accountLink.txt`, which tracks which Minecraft UUIDs are connected to which Discord Snowflake IDs. A new entry will be recorded every time unless the UUID has already been registered. If a Discord ID or UUID is relinked, the previous link will be removed. One Discord ID connects to one UUID.

Dreamvisitor will then check whether or not the account is already whitelisted. If they are not, they are added to the whitelist. Either way, the user will be directed to check the FAQ for the IP.

## Stages & Events

You can use Discord's event system to make it more convenient for members to find information and participate in an event. To create an event:

- Click on the Events button at the top of the channel list.
- In the pop-up menu, click **Create Event**.
- Choose a location for your event.
- Define the topic, date, and time. You can also add a description and cover image.
- Review your event and click create.

If your event is in a stage channel, you should know how a stage channel works. The stage channel plays background music while there are no speakers. When you attempt to join the stage, you are presented with three options:<

- **Start the Stage** - Pick a topic to start the conversation. This will begin an event.
- **Create Event** - Schedule a Stage for a future date. This will take you through the same process as above.
- **Continue without starting** - This will let you join the stage without starting an event.

If an event is scheduled, you will have the option to start that event.

A stage channel has two parts: the speakers and the audience. The speakers can be heard by everyone. The audience is unable to speak and can only listen to the speakers. As a **Stage Moderator**, you can freely switch between the stage and the audience. Stage Moderators are indicated by a badge that appears while a speaker.

Users who are not Stage Moderators cannot join the stage unless invited by a Stage Moderator. Users can indicate they desire to join the speakers, but they must be approved by a Stage Moderator. In either case, the user then must accept the invitation to finally join the speakers.

Stages support many features found in voice channels. Stages have built-in chats where all users can send messages. Speaker invitations also appear here for Stage Moderators. Screen sharing is supported by Stages and both speakers and the audience will always have this stream open. However, there can only be one stream at a time.

When your event is over, you can end the event instead of disconnecting to end the Discord event and disconnect all users from the stage.
