The Wings of Fire: The New World royalty system is complex, but it must be as simple and intuitive as possible for players. Admins alone primarily manage and oversee the royalty system and there are many different steps to operate it correctly. Here is the simplified pipeline:

<div
    style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 10px; justify-items: center; text-align: center; font-weight: 300;">
    <p>A player initiates a challenge.</p>
    <div style="width: 50px; border: solid 1px; height: 0; justify-self: center;"></div>
    <p>The challenge takes place.</p>
    <div style="width: 50px; border: solid 1px; height: 0;"></div>
    <p>The royalty board changes accordingly.</p>
</div>

The [Eye of Onyx](2.html#eyeofonyx) plugin automates this system. Players can participate in the royalty system without staff involvement.

## Challenge Handshakes

{% include split.html contentleft="

A challenge can be initiated with `/challenge`. To initiate a challenge, a player must meet the following requirements:

- The player must be part of a tribe-associated team.
- The player must not already be participating in a challenge.
- The player must not be on movement cooldown.
- The player must not be a ruler.
- The player must not be banned from royalty.

If all these requirements are met, the player will be given the option to challenge one of the positions directly above their own. When chosen, Eye of Onyx will verify that the player being challenged (the defender) meets the following requirements:

- The player must not already be participating in a challenge.
- The player must not be on movement cooldown.

If all these requirements are met, the challenge will be initiated! The defender then must acknowledge the challenge via the notification received.

Players may have more than one requested challenge at a time. If both heirs simultaneously challenge the ruler, the ruler may choose which to accept if neither have yet been acknowledged. Once a challenge has been accepted, all other requests are discarded and no further challenges can be initiated against the player.

Before a challenge can be accepted, the defender must use Eye of Onyx's web-based Royalty Portal to submit at least one date and time for the challenge to take place. After submitting available times, the challenge is considered accepted. Players who have received a challenge request must accept it within a set number of days before they are automatically removed. After the defender accepts the challenge, the attacker must select one of the propsed times. When one is chosen, the challenge is considered finalized.

At the time agreed upon, the challenge will be considered active and players will be promted to teleport to the challenge lobby. From here, the competitors will select which challenge to play. When both teams are ready, the challenge will begin. After the game, the winner will stay on the royalty board and the loser will be removed.

Players are allowed five total minutes of offline time. If a player disconnects for two minutes, they can disconnect for another three before their time is out. If a player runs out of offline time, the other player is automatically considered the winner. This way, a challenge will never end in a stalemate, even when both players leave the game.

The royalty board will then be updated accordingly.

## Royalty Management

In some cases, it may be necessary to manually manage the royalty board. Internally, the royalty board is considered a set of 10 different states, one per tribe. Each of these states have five positions, ruler, heir apparent, heir presumptive, noble apparent, and noble presumptive. No state can affect another, so they all act independently. In addition to the royalty board itself, Eye of Onyx also manages royalty roles (on both guilds) as well as permissions through LuckPerms, which control claim permissions.

Below are all Eye of Onyx commands. Note the following:

- When an argument requires a player or entity, it will always allow vanilla [target selectors](1.html#target-selectors).
- Times will always attempt to display in your local time zone (determined through approximate geo-location). When submitting a time, submit it using your local time.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/royalty list [tribe]` | üìó Lists the royalty board. If a tribe is specified, only that tribe will be reported. |
| `/royalty set <player> <position>` | üõ°Ô∏è üìó Sets the specified member to the specified position of their tribe. This will overwrite the specified position of their tribe. If a player is overwritten, their roles and permissions will be removed and their challenges will be canceled. If there are empty positions available above the target position, the player will automatically be promoted to the highest empty position. The player will be given appropriate roles and permissions. This action will fail if the player is banned, the player has no recorded tribe, or the player is already on the royalty board. This command, upon succeeding, will set the user's last online time to the current time, regardless of when the player was actually last online. |
| `/royalty clear <tribe> <position>` | üõ°Ô∏è üìó Clears the entry at the specified location and updates the royalty board. This will cancel any challenges involving this player as well as remove their roles and permissions. If any players occupy positions below the player to be removed, they will automatically be promoted. |
| `/royalty swap <tribe> <pos1> <pos2>` | üõ°Ô∏è üìó Swap two positions on a tribe's royalty board. This will cancel any challenges involving these players. It is allowed to swap any position with any position, which means it is possible to swap an occupied position with an empty position. If you want to swap with a player who is not on the royalty board, `/set` should be used instead. |
| `/royalty update` | üõ°Ô∏è üìí Reloads, recalculates, and updates the entire royalty board. It may take some time to completely apply permissions and roles. When executed, Eye of Onyx will reload `board.yml` from disk and recalculate the positions, permissions, and roles of each position on each state. Note that this command does not check any players who are not on the royalty board, so non-royalty members will not have any checks or updates. |
| `/royalty manage <tribe> <position> [key] [value]` | üõ°Ô∏è üìï Manually set data values in board.yml. If you execute the command without the `[key]` or `[value]` arguments, Eye of Onyx will print all the attributes of that position. If only the `[value]` argument is missing, Eye of Onyx will print the key specified. Below are all keys and their descriptions. `UUID`: The UUID of the player holding this position. This cannot be changed. `NAME`: The OC name of the player. This is usually set automatically from the player's OpenRP character. `JOINED_POS`: The date and time that this player assumed their current position. `JOINED_BOARD`: The date and time that this player joined the royalty board. `LAST_ONLINE`: The date and time that this player last joined or left the game. `CHALLENGER`: The player challenging this position. `CHALLENGER`: The player challenging this position. This does not appear for ruler positions. |
| `/eyeofonyx ban <username>` | üõ°Ô∏è üìó Adds a player to the royalty ban list. Banned players may not participate in royalty. This disallows them access to the <code>/challenge</code> command and will remove them from the royalty board if they are currently occupying a position. |
| `/eyeofonyx unban <username>` | üõ°Ô∏è üìó Removes a player from the royalty ban list. |
| `/eyeofonyx freeze` | üõ°Ô∏è üìï Toggles whether the royalty board can change or not. In the frozen state, challenge initiation and royalty board movement are disabled. |
| `/eyeofonyx disable` | üõ°Ô∏è ‚úñÔ∏è Disables the Eye of Onyx plugin. Use in a dire emergency. |
| `/eyeofonyx config [key] [value]` | üõ°Ô∏è üìï Allows changing some values in config.yml. |
| `/challenge` | üìó Initiate a challenge. |
