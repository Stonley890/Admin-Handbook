There are a variety of plugins that add important or convenient commands. Not all of the plugins we use have commands to know and those that do may not have commands that need to be memorized and used frequently. Here are the plugins we currently use:

Plugins, unlike data packs and resource packs, are not a vanilla Minecraft feature, nor a client-side modification such as a mod. The community-built Bukkit API (as well as the expanded Spigot and Paper APIs) provides the capability that plugins have. Having optimized direct hooks into the main thread as well as being multithreaded allows them to be much more optimized than data packs (in general).

{% include sidenote.html content="On a single-player Minecraft world, the world runs on an internal server. When you open a world, that server starts and connects your client to itself. **The _server side_ does all the back-end world management and tick calculation.** It path-finds mobs, calculates light levels, and runs things like redstone and command blocks. **The _client side_ is the actual interface that the player uses to interact with the world, but it doesn't do any world generation or entity ticking.** The client side is just responsible for letting the player interact with the game (moving, changing blocks, running commands, rendering the game). This concept is similar on a multiplayer server. The only difference is that all the previous server-side tasks are handled on a separate computer (the server) that the client connects to. **All world updates run on the server side and have to be sent to the client for each tick.**" %}
                
## [CoreProtect](https://docs.coreprotect.net/)

## [Dreamvisitor](https://github.com/stonley890/Dreamvisitor/wiki)
Dreamvisitor, created by Bog specifically for the server, has a variety of features. It serves as an all-in-one utility plugin and Discord bot.

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `/dvset` | 📗 Open Dreamvisitor options. |
| `/aradio <message>` | 🛡️ 📗 The admin radio sends a message to all online operators and the console. |

| `/zoop` | 🛡️ 📗 Vanish from Discord. This command should be used with Essentials `/vanish` and a false disconnect tellraw. |

### Item Blacklist
`/itemblacklist` will open a chest-like inventory. Items placed in this container will be saved in their place and players with matching items will have them automatically removed from non-operator player inventories. **This removal is permanent.** Be cautious of items you add. **Items are only removed if the data is an exact match.** If you put a potato into the blacklist GUI, potatoes that have been renamed or enchanted will not be removed.

![A demonstration of the item blacklist.](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0gH6woVlWJzaanhzgc0o8121lrALOaPUCC8aZix1Cxr6Zwokr218AT7QcPQLgeUbBaTNR1Gq6Aum7-R8wCYko1sBSVYIsaLaji5quwqjI8lVdrqxqsi3E10dO1edqsmvRIXRn8G2__I53NAvMBV0jz0)

{% include caption.html content="A demonstration of the item blacklist." %}

### Soft Whitelist
The soft whitelist acts as a secondary whitelist that works much like Minecraft's built-in whitelist feature. This allows reducing the allowed players to a specified group while not modifying the main whitelist. Players with the `dreamvisitor.nowhitelist` permission will always bypass the soft whitelist. **Operators will always bypass the soft whitelist.**

### Sandbox Mode
**Sandbox Mode** is a feature that allows administrators to safely allow players to use Creative Mode. When a player is put into Sandbox Mode, their inventory is swapped, and they are put into Creative Mode with the following restrictions:

- They cannot access containers.
- They cannot drop items.
- They cannot use spawn eggs.
- They cannot teleport.

A player with the `dreamvisitor.sandbox` permission (who will be referred to as an admin) must be online for Sandbox Mode to remain active. If all admins leave, all players in Sandbox Mode will be removed from Sandbox Mode, restoring their inventories. If players leave the game while in Sandbox Mode, they will remain in Sandbox Mode when they rejoin unless there are no admins. When a Sandboxed player joins, admins will be notified.            

### Pause Chat
The `/pausechat` command will stop all incoming chat messages from being broadcasted. It will also block messages from `/me` and Discord passthrough. You can allow certain players to bypass this with `/pausebypass`. Players with the `dreamvisitor.nopause` permission will always bypass chat pause. **Operators will always bypass chat pause.**
            
## [EssentialsX](https://essinfo.xeya.me/commands.html)
EssentialsX is the most comprehensive general-purpose plugin available. It provides teleportation, moderation tools, gameplay enhancements, homes, warps, sign shops, kits, and everything in between. Being a general-purpose plugin, it doesn't excel at any specific feature or function, but its versatility means there are a lot of commands to consider. Here are the most important for an admin:

### Powertools
`/powertool` allows you to assign a command to an item. Pressing the attack button (left mouse button by default) will execute the command. The argument `{player}` will insert the name of a clicked player. There are five flags you can prepend to the argument that change the behavior of `/powertool. c:` will create a chat macro. Instead of running a command, the powertool will send a chat message. Use `a:` to append multiple commands. Use `r:` to remove a single command from a powertool. Use `l:` to list all power tools and their commandes. Use `d:` to remove all power tools.
            
Examples:
```mcfunction
/powertool setblock ~ ~-1 ~ stone
# Executes 'setblock ~ ~-1 ~ stone' on click

/powertool effect give {player} regeneration
# Gives regeneration to a clicked player

/powertool a:effect give {player} saturation
# Adds a subsequent command to give saturation to a clicked player
```

## [WorldGuard](https://worldguard.enginehub.org/en/latest/)
WorldGuard is a plugin that allows operators to create regions with specific game rules and functions. The [WorldEdit CUI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldeditcui-fabric) mod is recommended for some helpful visual information when using this tool. This guide will cover the most common commands. More in-depth information can be found at the [WorldGuard Documentation Hub](https://worldguard.enginehub.org/en/latest/).

### Flags
Below are protection-based flags. Note that there are three default permission groups: `non-member`, `member`, and `owner`. **You do not need to set any flags to protect a region.** Also note that flags are not player-specific. Setting `block-break` to deny will prevent pistons, endermen, and any other mechanics that move or remove blocks from doing so because setting that flag denies access to **members**.

A member is defined as anything *inside* the region. By default, pistons will work inside the region, but pistons outside the region cannot push blocks inside because they are *non-members*. Because players are non-members by default, you don't need to set any flags for protection, and it still allows members to function correctly. In specific cases, you may want to disallow any block modification whatsoever. What you want to do is to **deny building for all permission groups.** This is when you want to set `build` to `deny`.

Region groups are powerful, but can be difficult to understand. Keep this in mind: Members are objects that exist/originate within the region. Non-members are objects that do not exist/originate within the region, including all players. Most flags, by default, unset, allow *members* but deny *non-members*. Setting a flag to `allow` or `deny` applies that setting to both members and non-members.
