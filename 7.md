Below are various systems on the server along with how they work.

## Tribe Change

Players may change their tribe every 60 days. After joining for the first time, they must wait 60 days before they can be allowed to change their tribe again. There is a hall at the bottom of the Hub where players can re-enter the tribe selection if their cooldown period is over. Their cooldown is reset after leaving the tribe change area, whether they make a change or not. Players can run `/tribechange` to get their remaining cooldown time.

Player tribe change cooldowns are stored on the `TribeChangeCooldown` scoreboard objective. The system is controlled by a set of command blocks in the admin cave. `.global` is increased by one every second to count time. Player scores are compared with this global counter to determine cooldown. `.max_cooldown` is the duration in seconds that the cooldown should be. Every time `.global` is increased by one, `.cooldown_end` is calculated by subtracting `.max_cooldown` from `.global`. After a tribe set or change, a player's score is set to the current `.global` score. Players cannot enter the tribe selection area until their score is less than `.cooldown_end`, which means that the number of seconds of `.max_cooldown` must pass before they can be allowed again.

Note that this system may not always be accurate, as it is tied to the main server ticking thread. It does not count while the server is not running and it will not count true time if the server is running slowly.
