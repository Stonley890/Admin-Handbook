## What are the responsibilities of administrators?
Admins are responsible for moderation, technical, and social aspects on both the Discord and Minecraft servers. Our expertise is on the Minecraft server, as they have had at least three months of training in command blocks and plugins. We plan, schedule, arrange, and host major events such as wars, official parties, VAs, and competitions are admin-hosted and managed. Admins are also responsible for doing things like handling rule-breaking, putting in warp command blocks, remedying bugs, troubleshooting server issues, suggesting and managing plugins, and training new trial admins. Admins also suggest major changes on both servers and help to arrange staff meetings.

## How does this differ from other staff positions?
Although Helper and Moderator positions share similarities with admins, these positions are more focused on community management rather than technical skills, event creation, or significant administrative changes. To do this, administrators are granted the highest level of technical power and therefore require more training than a Moderator or Helper in addition to the training required for other positions. Because of this, admin training is often much longer and contains more content than mod training, requiring much more training in Minecraft.

## The purpose of this handbook
This handbook is designed to be a resource for new and old admins alike to find compiled information about being an admin to better educate trial admins and make the information easily accessible for senior admins. It includes practical documentation on Minecraft commands, plugins, data packs, server performance, event creation, project management, staff management, and player interactions. External resources will often be provided for further reading if you're interested in finding out more about a particular topic.
