Being in a high position of responsibility requires that you personally meet that responsibility. There are some additional things to keep in mind:

## Security

Especially in larger communities, your position makes your accounts — Discord, Minecraft, or other platforms — valuable to those involved in the community (as a member or to intentionally cause disruption). You should take steps to ensure your account is secure to keep the community safe. Here are some basic tips:

- **Use an email address you own.** Your email is used to recover your account if something goes wrong. Make sure you (and only you) have access to your email.
- **Turn on two-factor authentication.** Two-factor authentication is an extremely powerful security measure and you should have it enabled for as many accounts as possible.
- **Be careful about logins.** Don't log into devices you don't own. If you need to, use private/incognito mode and close the session when you're finished. Many services allow you to view devices logged into your account. Remove any you don't recognize and change your password.
- **Don't share your token.** Even a strong password with two-factor authentication can be completely bypassed if your login token is exposed. This token allows logged-in devices to have a temporary key so that you don't have to log in again. An attacker can use that token on their own device, so never share internal app information like the developer console.
- **Use common sense.** Don't download suspicious files, ensure you trust executables, and be wary of third-party services that require login. If you think something is a red flag, it probably is. Ask a technical friend if you're unsure.
