Operators in Minecraft have access to all Minecraft commands including multiplayer-specific commands like ban and kick. As an admin, you are also an operator. Minecraft commands are essential to navigate the server as an admin. **All Minecraft-native commands begin with the namespace `minecraft:`.** Below is a table detailing all Minecraft commands in 1.20.2.

## Notation Guide

📗 — These are generally **safe to run** and/or are **highly unlikely to have any negative effect** on the server.<br>
📒 — These are **high level** and/or have **decent potential to impact the server in a negative way** if used incorrectly. Exercise caution when using these commands, even if you know what you are doing.
📕 — These are **dangerous to misuse, affect the player experience,** or **may break installed server software.** Do not use these commands unless absolutely necessary, and use extreme caution if you must use these commands.
🛡️ — These require **additional permissions** to be executed and are not accessable by default.
✖️ — These should **never be used** or should **only be used by operators,** and sparingly  at that. **Do not use these without notifying other admins!**

There are a lot of commands, but most of them are either not important or are simple to understand. We'll go over some important commands and command syntax to know. You can always [check the wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Commands) for more information about specific commands.

## Target Selectors

Target selectors are used in commands to select players and entities arbitrarily, without needing to specify an exact player name or a UUID. One or more entities can be selected with a target selector variable, and targets can be filtered from the selection based on certain criteria using the target selector arguments.

{% include caption.html content="From the [Wiki page](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Target_selectors)" %}

{% include split.html contentleft="

**Target selector variables** are the first broad categories to select. Use the most specificoption whenpossible. If you want to target the nearest player, use `@p` instead of `@a[sort=nearest,limit=1]`. This dramatically reduces the query and will have better performance. `@e` generates a list of all existing entities, so try to limit use as much as possible.

" contentright="

| `@p` | nearest player |
| `@r` | random player |
| `@a` | all players |
| `@e` | all loaded, living entities |
| `@s` | entity executing the command |

" %}
            
{% include split.html contentleft="



Beyond the selector variables are the **target selector arguments**. These allow you to narrow your selection based on various attributes. Below are some important ones.

x, y, z can almost always be replaced by execute positioned <x> <y> <z> (see execute).

`distance` allows you to target entities within a specified *spherical range* in blocks. The entity will only be targeted if the origin of their hitbox (bottom center) is within the distance. This selector also limits the selection to the current dimension.

- `@e[distance=1.5]` — Target all entities exactly 1.5 blocks away.
- `@a[distance=8..16]` — Target all players from eight blocks to 16 blocks away (inclusive).

You can remove the minimum distance to search from 0 and/or remove the maximum distance to search infinitely beyond the minimum.

" contentright="

| `x`, `y`, `z` | coordinate |
| `distance` | distance |
| `dx`, `dy`, `dz` | volume dimensions |
| `scores` | scores |
| `tag` | tag |
| `team` | team |
| `name` | entity name |
| `type` | entity type |
| `x_rotation` | vertical rotation (pitch) |
| `y_rotation` | horizontal rotation (yaw) |
| `nbt` | nbt |
| `level` | experience level |
| `gamemode` | gamemode |
| `advancements` | advancements |
| `limit`, `sort` | selector limiting |

" %}

`dx`, `dy`, and `dz` select by rectangular volume from the command origin. These specify the distance from the origin rather than a global coordinate and extend asymmetrically. Unlike distance, volume selection targets entities if any part of their hitbox is inside the selection.

`scores`selects by matching scoreboard objectives. Targeted entities must have all specified scores on all specified objectives. You also can specify an integer range (inclusive) similar to the `distance` selector.

Here is the syntax:

```mcfunction
[scores={<objective>=<value>,...}]
```

And here is an example:
```mcfunction
tell @e[scores={myscore=..15}] ...
# Send a message to all entities with a score in "myscore" of up to 15
```

`tag` targets entities with a specified tag. Note that if you specify more than one, it will only target entities with both tags, not one or the other. You can use `[tag=!<string>]` to target entities without a specified tag, `[tag=]` to target entities without any tags, and `[tag=!]` to target entities with at least one tag.

`team` works in nearly the exact same way as tag, but players can only be on one team at a given time and so this argument can only be used once.

`nbt` is the most resource-intensive target selector argument. It searches for entities with specified NBT data. While uses are niche, no other argument can target NBT aside from `advancement` and `tag` in specific cases. For example, `@e[nbt={Item:{id:"minecraft:iron_sword"}}]` targets all entities that are iron swords. **Avoid using NBT unless ABSOLUTELY necessary as it has a high potential to lag.**

Finally, `limit` and `sort` can be used in tandem to limit the number of targeted entities. `limit` is an integer that defines the maximum amount of entities to be selected. `sort` has four possible values: `nearest`, `furthest`, `random`, or `arbitrary`. `nearest`sorts by increasing distance and `furthest`by decreasing distance. `random`is random and `arbitrary`sorts by the time of entity creation and is the default.

## Important Commands

### `/ban | ban-ip <player> [reason]`
Bans a player or ip from the server. The player does not have to be online to be banned. In addition to being added to the banlist, they will be [kicked](1.html#kick) automatically.

Examples:
```mcfunction
ban jjj_North
# Kick and ban jjj_North

ban-ip 7pencilsharpen3r Hacking
# Kick and ban 7pencilsharpen3r's IP for hacking, preventing any account from joining from that IP
```

### `/clear <selector> [item] [quantity]`
Clears an item or all items from a player or valid selector entities.

Examples:
```mcfunction
clear mmaurice196
# Clear every item from mmaurice196

clear @a[team=Skywing] cooked_beef 12
# Clear 12 steak from every player on the Skywing team

clear CalamityLegendz diamond_sword{Enchantments:[{id: "minecraft:sharpness", lvl: 1000s}]}
# Clear all diamond swords with Sharpness 1000 from CalamityLegendz

clear @s iron_sword{titanium: 1b} 0
# Check if the executing entity has an iron sword with the NBT "titanium:1b"

# By setting the quantity to 0, we can instead check if the selected entities have the item declared. This is mainly only useful in datapacks, but is nonetheless an interesting feature to know.
```

### `/datapack <disable | enable | list> <name>`
Enable a disabled data pack, disable an enabled data pack, or list all data packs.

Examples:
```mcfunction
datapack disable "file/Ender Dragon"
# Disable the "Ender Dragon" data pack

datapack enable "file/Example Datapack"
# Load the "Example Datapack" data pack

datapack list
# List all data packs
```

### `/execute [subcommands] [run <command>]`
Execute is an extremely powerful command that allows you to execute mutiple subcommands to modify given parameters, check for different variables, and fork the command execution.

- `align <axes>` - aligns the position of the command execution with the block position along the given axes. This allows you to to align to the center of a block.
- `anchored <anchor>` - sets the position of the command execution to either the eyes or feet of the executor.
- `as <targets>` - sets the executor without changing the location. You must use `at` to set the location. If multiple targets are selected, the following subcommands will apply to all targets
- `at <targets>` - sets the location of the execution without changing the executor. You must ust `as`to set the executor.
- `facing <pos | facing <targets> <anchor>>` - sets the execution rotation.
- `in <dimension>` - sets the execution dimension. This will account for distance scaling in the nether and custom dimensions.
- `on &lt attacker | controller | leasher | origin | owner | passengers | target | vehicle>` - sets the executor based on relation to the current executor.
- `positioned <pos | as | over>` - sets the execution position.
- `rotated <rot | as <targets>>` - sets the execution rotation.
- `summon <entity>` - summons a new entity at the execution position and sets it as the executor.

- `(if|unless) biome <pos> <biome>`- Checks for the given biome at a given position.
- `(if|unless) block <pos> <block>`- Checks for the given block at a given position.
- `(if|unless) blocks <start> <end> <destination> (all|masked)`- compares blocks in two volumes.
- `(if|unless) data <block | entity | storage> <source> <path>`- Checks whether the targeted block, entity or storage has any data tag for a given path.
- `(if|unless) dimension <dimension>`- Checks if the execution is in a matching dimension.
- `(if|unless) function <function>`- Checks a function or function tag and matches the return value(s). If a tag is given, all functions run regardless of the results of prior functions.
- `(if|unless) entity <entities>`- Checks whether one or more entities exist.
- `(if|unless) loaded <pos>`- Checks if chunks at a given position is fully loaded.
- `(if|unless) predicate <predicate>`- Checks whether the predicate successes. This is primarily a data pack feature.
- `(if|unless) score <target> <targetObjective> <operation>`- Checks whether a score has the specific relation to another score, or whether it is in a given range.

- `store (result|success) <block | bossbar | entity | score | storage>`

Minecraft will process subcommands in the order they are arranged in the command. Note that `execute ... run execute ... run ...` has no effect as it is essentially the same as `execute ... run`.

Examples:
```mcfunction
execute run say Hello, world!
# Execute say Hello, world!

execute as @e[type=pig] run say Hello, world!
# Make all pigs run the command "/say Hello, world!"

execute in the_end if block 0 64 0 beacon at @e[type=armor_stand,distance=0..] facing
0 64 0 run tp ^ ^ ^1
# Make all armor stands in the end teleport one block toward 0 64 0 if there is a beacon at 0 64 0. Note that the command will stop checking conditions in itself if there is no beacon at 0 64 0.
```

### `/give <selector> <item>[nbt]`
Gives the targeted selectors an item with optional NBT attached.

Examples:
```mcfunction
give BogTheMudWing potato
# Give BogTheMudWing 1 Potato

give @a[limit=10,sort=random] diamond{display: {Name: "Actual Coal"}}
# Give 10 random players a diamond named "Actual Coal"
```

### `/kick <player> [reason]`
Terminates a player's connection to the server.

Examples:
```mcfunction
kick FlawLessII
# Kick FlawLessII from the server

kick s0meb0dysupply Profanity
# Kick s0meb0dysupply from the server for profanity
```

### `/pardon | pardon-ip <player>`
Remove a player or an IP from the banlist, regranting said player or IP access to the server.

Examples:
```mcfunction
pardon jjj_North
# Pardon jjj_North

pardon-ip 7pencilsharpen3r
# Pardon 7pencilsharpen3rs IP
```

### `/scoreboard <objective | players> <add | enable | get | list | modify | operation> | remove | set | setdisplay> …`
Add objectives, get player scores, manipulate scoreboard objectives, and much more. This command is **very** extensive and powerful!

Examples:
```mcfunction
scoreboard objectives add player_health health
# Create a scoreboard objective called "player_health" that tracks... the players' health

scoreboard objectives modify player_health displayname {"text": "Player Health", "color": "red"}
# Modify the "player_health" scoreboard to appear as "Player Health"

scoreboard players get Julibeau WhiteKills
# Get Julibeau's score in the objective WhiteKills
```

### `summon <entity> [<posx posy posz> [NBT]]`
Summons an entity.

Examples:
```mcfunction
summon ender_dragon
# Summons an Ender Dragon

summon iron_golem ~ ~ ~ {NoAI: 1b}
# Summons an iron golem at the current position with no AI

summon cow ^ ^ ^10 {ActiveEffects:[{Id: 25, Amplifier: 10b, Duration: 200}], DeathLootTable: "chests/abandoned_mineshaft"}
# Summons a cow 10 blocks from the player's current direction with Levitation 11 for 10 seconds that will drop loot from an abandoned minecart... wow.
```

### `/tellraw <selector> [string or JSON]`
Announce a [highly-customizable message](https://www.minecraftjson.com/) to a selector using JSON.

Examples:
```mcfunction
tellraw FrazzledDingo "Welcome to the server!"
# Show the message "Welcome to the server!" to FrazzledDingo

tellraw @a[team=Green] {"text": "You are on the Green team!", "color": "dark_green"}
# Show the message "Welcome to the server!"" to all players on the Green team

tellraw @a[distance=..30] [{"selector": "@r[distance=..30]", "color": "red"}, {"text": " won the ", "color": "gray"}, {"text": "Grand Raffle", "color": "gold"}, {"text": "!", "color": "gray"}]
# Show the message "<random player up to 30 blocks away> won the Grand Raffle!" to all players up to 30 blocks away
```

### `/whitelist <add | on | off | reload | remove> <player>`
Add or remove a player from the whitelist, enable or disable the whitelist, or reload the whitelist.

Examples:
```mcfunction
whitelist add RaspberryConflict
# Adds RaspberryConflict to the whitelist

whitelist remove known__clams
# Removes known__clams from the whitelist

whitelist on
# Activates the whitelist, allowing only those on the whitelist to join the server
